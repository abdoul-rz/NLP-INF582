However, it is not guaranteed to find the best translation. The best translation is the one that maximizes the probability of the target sentence given the source sentence. The greedy decoding strategy only considers the most probable word at each time step, which may not lead to the best translation.\n","Also, the greedy decoding strategy does not consider the context of the entire sentence, which may lead to suboptimal translations. For example, the greedy decoding strategy may generate a translation that is grammatically incorrect or does not make sense.\n","\n","<hr style=\"border:10px solid green\"> </hr>\n","</font></h4>\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"z0m_Hw-NJopL"},"source":["<b><h4><font color='red'>\n","<hr style=\"border:10px solid red\"> </hr>\n","Question 2 (5 points): </b><br>\n","What major problem do you observe with our translations?\n","How could we remediate this issue?

This is due to the fact that the model is not able to capture the context of the entire sentence. To remediate this issue, we could use a beam search decoding strategy instead of the greedy decoding strategy. The beam search decoding strategy considers multiple possible translations at each time step and selects the most probable one. This allows the model to capture the context of the entire sentence and generate better translations. Another way to remediate this issue is to use a more complex model, such as a transformer model, which is able to capture the context of the entire sentence more effectively.\n","<hr style=\"border:10px solid green\"> </hr>\n","</font></h4>\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"RawMHJkMJk-r"},"source":["<b><h4><font color='red'>\n","<hr style=\"border:10px solid red\"> </hr>\n","Question 3 (5 points): </b><br>\n","Write some code to visualize source/target alignments in the style of Fig. 3 in <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473'>[Bahdanau et al., 2014]</a> or Fig. 7 in <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025'>[Luong et al., 2015]</a>.\n","Interpret your figures for some relevant examples (e.g. to illustrate adjective-noun inversion)\n","<hr style=\"border:10px solid red\"> </hr>\n","</font></h4>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-02-10T20:18:18.429473Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-02-10T20:18:18.429190Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-02-10T20:18:18.434076Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-02-10T20:18:18.433268Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-02-10T20:18:18.429449Z"},"id":"K4eaYTs3E4gQ","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# Your code here\n","import matplotlib.ticker as ticker  \n","\n","class seq2seqModel(nn.Module):\n","\n","    def sourceNl_to_ints(self, source_nl):\n","        '''converts natural language source sentence into source integers'''\n","        source_nl_clean = source_nl.lower().replace(\"'\",' ').replace('-',' ')\n","        source_nl_clean_tok = word_tokenize(source_nl_clean, self.source_language)\n","        source_ints = [int(self.vocab_s[elt]) if elt in self.vocab_s else \\\n","                       self.oov_token for elt in source_nl_clean_tok]\n","\n","        source_ints_tensor = torch.LongTensor(source_ints).to(self.device)\n","        return source_ints, source_ints_tensor\n","    \n","    def prediction(self, source_nl):\n","        source_ints,  source_ints_tensor= self.sourceNl_to_ints(source_nl)\n","        logits = self.forward(source_ints_tensor, self.max_size, True) # (seq) -> (<=max_size, vocab)\n","        target_ints = logits[0].argmax(-1).squeeze() # (<=max_size, 1) -> (<=max_size)\n","        target_nl = self.targetInts_to_nl(target_ints.tolist())\n","        source_nl = self.sourceNl_to_ints(source_ints)\n","        return source_nl, target_nl, logits[1]\n","\n","     \n","\n","def source_target_alignment(source_nl, target_nl, attention_weights):\n","\n","    fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n","    cax = ax.matshow(attention_weights, cmap='bone')\n","\n","    ax.set_xticklabels([''] + source_nl, rotation=90)\n","    ax.set_yticklabels([''] + target_nl)\n","\n","    ax.xaxis.set_major_locator(ticker.MultipleLocator(1))\n","    ax.yaxis.set_major_locator(ticker.MultipleLocator(1))\n","\n","    plt.show()\n","\n","\n","model = seq2seqModel.load(path_to_save_models + 'my_model.pt')\n","\n","to_alignement = []\n","\n","for elt in to_test:\n","    source_nl, target_nl, attention_weights = model.predict(elt)\n","    to_alignement.append((source_nl, target_nl, attention_weights))\n","\n","for elt in to_alignement:\n","    source_target_alignment(elt[0], elt[1], elt[2])\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-HY_LqQoJW_z"},"source":["<b><h4><font color='green'>\n","<hr style=\"border:10px solid green\"> </hr>\n","Answer 3: </b><br>\n","Your answer here\n","<hr style=\"border:10px solid green\"> </hr>\n","</font></h4>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_jRkSDMjFXLH"},"source":["\n","\n","\n","<b><h4><font color='red'>\n","<hr style=\"border:10px solid red\"> </hr>\n","Question 4 (5 points): </b><br>\n","What do you observe in the translations of the sentences below?\n","What properties of language models does that illustrate?\n","Read <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365'>[Peters et al., 2018]</a> and <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805'>[Devlin et al., 2018]</a>  to get some ideas.\n","<ul>\n","<b><h4><font color='red'>\n","<li>I did not mean to hurt you\n","<li>She is so mean\n","</ul>\n","<hr style=\"border:10px solid red\"> </hr>\n","</font></h4>\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"4AyxolVhJU5u"},"source":["<b><h4><font color='green'>\n","<hr style=\"border:10px solid green\"> </hr>\n","Answer 4: </b><br>\n","Your answer here\n","<hr style=\"border:10px solid green\"> </hr>\n","</font></h4>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Z--prNCiJ0Un"},"source":["<h3><b>6.
